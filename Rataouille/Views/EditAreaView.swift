I initially planned to implement a feature set in this view, including handling relationships between areas and meals in Core Data. The goal was to display meals in ascending order based on the selected area. However, due to unexpected challenges with the database, I had to reprioritize tasks to meet the project deadlines.

If time permitted, the following features would have been implemented:

    1. Handling Relationships: Establishing relationships (e.g., one area to many meals) in Core Data to enable more dynamic and detailed displays.

    2. Entity Structure: Creating separate entities for areas, ingredients, and categories.

    3. Relationship Networks: Establishing relationships not only between meals and areas but also between meals, ingredients, and categories.

    4. Enhanced EditViews: Expanding the EditViews for areas, ingredients, and categories to include a list of meals associated with each.

    5. Detailed Meal Editing: Creating a detailed Meal Editing View, linked from this EditAreaView, allowing users to edit various details of a chosen meal, such as its name, category, instructions, ingredients, and area.

Despite the project not reaching its full feature set, I have laid the groundwork for future enhancements. Time constraints led to a focus on delivering a functional and user-friendly experience. The current version provides a foundation for future iterations, allowing for integration of additional features and improvements.
